On-going project at CEERI, Pilani.
----------------------------------
Works with 3 Microsoft Kinect sensors simultaneously, to detect the person speaking.

Include MS Kinect.Toolit and Kinect.Toolkit.Facetracking in the VS Project Solution.

## Things Done

* <strikethrough> Initialise multiple Kinects and run them concurrently.

## Things to be done Next

* Create a wrapper so that a new Kinect can be initialised with one command.

* [Optional]: Automatic addition of sensor if a new Kinect is connected to the computer.

* Extract faces of people facing the different Kinect sensors and display their profile view.
